# ParQ

The ParQ mobile app enables drivers to find available parking and rates from parking vendors in their area and parking lots available from 3rd party APIs, e.g., [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps), [SpotHero API](https://spothero.com/developers), [ParkMe API](https://www.parkme.com/). Parking vendors can register their parking locations on ParQ and drivers can reserve those parking spots in the ParQ app. There are plans to integrate a payment system in the future to accompany the parking vendor's booking system.
